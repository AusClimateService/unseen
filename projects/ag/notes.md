Rank (from driest to wettest) in the observational record (1900-2019)
and return period (rp) in the 34,272 sample model ensemble
for each region and wheat import year.

|      | all                 | south-west        | south-east        | north-east         |

| 2019 | rank 1 (2142 years) | rank 1 (40 years) | rank 6 (18 years) | rank 1 (685 years) | 
| 2002 | rank 2 (51 years)   | rank 8 (14 years) | rank 8 (16 years) | rank 6 (13 years)  |
| 1994 | rank 4 (31 years)   | rank 4 (27 years) | rank 10 (10 years)| rank 9 (8 years)   |

Observational record, inter-region correlations:
- south-east vs north-east annual rainfall: 0.67
- south-east vs south-west annual rainfall: 0.45
- north-east vs south-west annual rainfall: 0.15

So the special features of 2019 was the exceptionally low rainfall in the north-east coupled with record-low rainfall in the south-west also (rainfall in these two regions isn't correlated).

Note that north-east rainfall (617 mm/year over 8 grid cells) dominates the wheat-sheep total
(south-west and south-east are 412 mm/year and 373 mm/year respectively over 6 grid cells each).
